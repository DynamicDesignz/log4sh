# log4sh
log4sh is an advanced logging framework for shell scripts (eg. sh, bash) that
works similar to the logging products available from the Apache Software
Foundataion (eg. log4j, log4perl).

Over the years, there have been several releases of log4sh. Separate releases
were made to enable users to depend upon features remaining stable across major
versions. Now we are in the days of GitHub where everyone can download the
latest release. The code will be changed to support this model, and specific
releases will be maintained on branches (or at least that is the plan).

Documentation for each release is included in the `doc/` folder of the release (e.g. [1.5/doc/log4sh.md](https://github.com/kward/log4sh/blob/master/1.5/doc/log4sh.md)).

log4sh was originally hosted on Source Forge as
https://sourceforge.net/p/log4sh/. It moved here to be hosted alongside the
other projects by @kward (https://github.com/kward).
